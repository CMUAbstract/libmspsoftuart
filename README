Software UART example for MSP430 using mps430-gcc on Linux  
sw@kaltpost.de
http://gpio.kaltpost.de/

The original code is taken form TI example on Timer_A uart. 

Introduction
------------

This example shows how to use software UART on the TI Launchpad with a MSP430G2231 MCU (which does NOT have a hardware UART). 

Compilation
------------

Note: This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux (I used v4.5.3 which is available as package on ubuntu). For flashing the "mspdebug" tool was used (also from the Ubuntu package).

To compile the source just issue a:

make

This builds the firmware in the "bin" subdirectory in various formats.


Doxygen Docs
------------

If you installed doxygen on your system, you could generate the HTML-based documentation by calling:

make gen-docs

This will create the documentation under "doc/gen/html".


Flashing
------------

To flash the firmware to your Launchpad you could use the "flash-target" make target:

make flash-target


Usage
------------

Connecting your Launchpad should give you a new serial device "/dev/ttyACM0". Connect to this port at 9600 bauds - e.g. by using screen:

screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600

Every character you type will be echoed then, surrounded by square brackets.
